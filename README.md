## Overview

Sequence Trainer is an browser based memory application developed for the Interactive Front End Development assessment. The application challenges users to memorise and repeat a dequence of coloured pads. This ranges in difficulty and provides immediate visual feedback after each interaction.

This project demonstrates the use of front end technologies to create a responsive and interactive eperience whilst ensuring user actions are handled efficiently and consistently.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project were: 

- To develop an engaging browser based memory game that increases in difficulty as the user progresses.

- To provide clear and immediate visual feed back providing clarity on what is happening during game play.

- to design a responsive interface that works across desktop and mobile screen sizes.

- Consider accessibility by using semantic HTML and visible focus states.

- To meet the assessment criteria by demonstrating JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation and structured organisation.


## Target Audience and User Stories

This application is designed and aimed at casual users who enjoy short logic-based games, as well as users who want to improve memory and concentration skills. It is also suitable for students or individuals who are looking for a lightweigh activity that can be played simply without installation on desktop or mobile devices.

User stories

- As a user, I want to start and restart the game easily so i can play multiple rounds and games.

- As a user, I want to clearly know when it is my turn so i do not make mistakes and i am focusing at the correct time.

- As a user, I want the sequence to change in difficulty as I progress.

- As a user, I want my best score to be saved between sessions.

- As a user, as a keybaord user, i want to navigate and interact with the game without needing a mouse.

- As a user, I want to recieve feedback that is cear when I make a mistake.


## UX and Design Process

The design process focused on creating a simple yet intuitive interface that would be easy for first-time users to understand without instructions or hints. The game board was designed to be placed centrally to immediate attention to the main interaction area, whilst controls such as Start, Restart and difficulty selection were positioned nearby to reduce unneecessary movement across the screen.

Accessibility was considered throughout development by using semantic HMTL visible focuc states for keyboard navigation, clear colour contrast and readable text sizes. Buttons were designed to be large enough for touch interaction and status messages were added to communicate whether the user should be watching the sequence or entering input.

Responsiveness was achieved using Bootstrap's grid system and flexible layouts so the inteface adapts cleanly to smaller screens and alrger desktop/tablet displays. Design were reviewed, adjusted and refined during development to ensure the application remained usable, visually conistent and aligned with the original design intentions.
