## Overview

Sequence Trainer is an browser based memory application developed for the Interactive Front End Development assessment. The application challenges users to memorise and repeat a dequence of coloured pads. This ranges in difficulty and provides immediate visual feedback after each interaction.

This project demonstrates the use of front end technologies to create a responsive and interactive eperience whilst ensuring user actions are handled efficiently and consistently.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project were: 

- To develop an engaging browser based memory game that increases in difficulty as the user progresses.

- To provide clear and immediate visual feed back providing clarity on what is happening during game play.

- to design a responsive interface that works across desktop and mobile screen sizes.

- Consider accessibility by using semantic HTML and visible focus states.

To meet the assessment criteria by demonstrating JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation and structured organisation.
